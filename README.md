### Executing program

* To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {}

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
